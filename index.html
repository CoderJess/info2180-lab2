                        of websites and web applications that run on a browser. There are many features 
                        of web development which includes designing, adding functionality to apps and 
                        management of a database. A summary of the phases of web development includes frontend,

                        Frontend refers what the users see whenever they rquest a page. There are many designing
                        tools and frameworks that are used on the frontend. These include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language),
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) and JavaScript. There are also JavaScript frameworks. One of the most
                        popular is Reactjs. HTML uses tags and elements to create content that is to be displayed on
                        screen. CSS is used to style the HTML and JavaScript is used to add functionality to the contents
                        on the screen such as when a user clicks a button. Reactjs is used to create interactive user interfaces
                        It's a collection of components capable of outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code. React also
                        enhances the performance speed of programs. Backend development on the other hand is the unseen part of 
                        web development. This allows for database and application to comunicate with each other. Programming 
                        languages used in backend web development includes Python (Django and Flask), Java, Nodejs, PHP, etc.
